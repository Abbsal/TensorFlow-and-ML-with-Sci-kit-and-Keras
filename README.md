# Prediction model using TensorFlow with-Sci-kit-and-Keras
This project is my attempt to gain hands on knowledge of Machine learning using TensorFlow and Keras.

I have used most of the methodologies from the TensorFlow documentation: 
https://www.tensorflow.org/learn

## TensorFlow with Sci-kit learn and Keras module for pre-processing.

Hardware specifications: 
Runtime - Python 3
GPU - T4 GPU provided by Google colab.

This project is based on the Titanic dataset with the goal of predicting passenger survival, given characteristics such as gender, age, class, etc.
