# Prediction model using TensorFlow with-Sci-kit-and-Keras
This project is my attempt to gain hands on knowledge of Machine learning using TensorFlow and Keras.

I have used most of the methodologies from the TensorFlow documentation: 
https://www.tensorflow.org/learn

This model trains a logistic regression model using the (tf.estimator) API. The model is often used as a baseline for other, more complex, algorithms.
The linear estimator uses both numeric and categorical features. Feature columns work with all TensorFlow estimators and their purpose is to define the features used for modeling.

## TensorFlow with Sci-kit learn and Keras module for pre-processing.

Hardware specifications: 
Runtime - Python 3
GPU - T4 GPU provided by Google colab.

This project is based on the Titanic dataset with the goal of predicting passenger survival, given characteristics such as gender, age, class, etc.
